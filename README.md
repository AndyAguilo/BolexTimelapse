# BolexTimelapse
A arduino based film timelapse controller.

This code is used to controll a Stepper motor that should be connected directly to the cotor pin of the camera. 
You will need a LCD 16x2 a Keypad to enter the the number of frames you want to take and the time between each frame. The * button on the keypad is the enter button for the script.
